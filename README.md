# What is DevOps

### DevOps benefit to buisness
DevOps link the sofware development teams with the opperations team, creating better communication between the two, and automate testing. This creates the ability to continously create, test and deploy software, with much faster feedback cycles. 
The benefits include:
- Faster delivery time
- High collaboration between teams
- Greater customer service
- Early defect detection
- Continious Release and deployment
- Innovative mindset

### devops tools
- GIT
- SQL
- Jenkins
- Docker
- AWS

### Cloud computing 
Cloud computing is the delivery of computer services online ( servers, storage, databases, networking ).
It allows companies to only pay for the services they utilise rather than having to constantly upscale and downscale their own system.

### SAAS, PAAS & IAAS

- Saas is Software as a service (e.g. Dropbox)
  - High accessibility, and compatible with other operating systems
  - Low upfront costs 
  - Requires internet connection
- Paas is Platform as a service (e.g. Windows Azure)
  - Reduces coding time
  - Affordable
- Iaas is Infastructure as a service (e.g. AWS)
  - Eliminates capital expense and reduces ongoing costs
  - Improves business continuity and disaster recovery
  - Increase stability, reliability and supportability

### Hybrid and Public cloud
##### Hybrid cloud
A hybrid cloud is a type of cloud computing that combines on-premises infrastructure—or a private cloud—with a public cloud. Hybrid clouds allow data and apps to move between the two environments.
Benefits:
- Greater flexibility
- More deployment options
- Security
- Compliance

##### Public cloud
Public clouds are the most common type of cloud computing deployment. The cloud resources (like servers and storage) are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the internet. With a public cloud, all hardware, software, and other supporting infrastructure are owned and managed by the cloud provider. Microsoft Azure is an example of a public cloud.
Benefits:
- Lower costs
- No maintenence
- Near-unlimited scalability
- High reliability
